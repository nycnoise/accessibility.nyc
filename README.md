## 2023 digital accessibility report

as the mayor's "designee," the nyc **mayor's office for people with disabilities** ([MOPD](https://www.nyc.gov/site/mopd/index.page)) is required by [local law 26](http://www.nyc.gov/assets/mopd/downloads/pdf/local_law_26.pdf) to publish a biennial "report that documents the compliance of websites maintained by or on behalf of the city".

**the 2023 [report](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/mopd/downloads/pdf/2023-NYC-Digital-Accessibility-Report-Final.pdf) does not include audit results**; its associated "[appendix 1](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/mopd/downloads/excel/2023-Appendix-1--WCAG-2_1-Survey-Tool.xlsx)" is an empty template with no scores.

in fact, despite being completed & published months after its legal deadline, the majority of the 2023 report is copied verbatim from 2021, with lengthy passages on testing methods, protocol, & scoring for an audit that does not appear to have happened. 

see:
* [2021 report](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/mopd/downloads/pdf/nyc-digital-accessibility-report-2021.pdf) (49 pages)
* [2021 appendix 1 survey tool](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/mopd/downloads/excel/Appendix-1-Survey-Tool-2021.xlsx), with audit of 11 websites
* [2023 report](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/mopd/downloads/pdf/2023-NYC-Digital-Accessibility-Report-Final.pdf) (17 pages; only substantive new content on pages 10, 11, 15, 16)

* [correspondence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hWv8sMsdNdrqx6tYDuGqA7U0cNA2J-rJ/view?usp=sharing): the 2023 digital accessibility report was due on july 1, 2023; i asked about the missing report on 11/17/23, & received a response on 12/18/23 saying it was "recently posted" to the MOPD's [reports & publications](https://www.nyc.gov/site/mopd/about/reports-publications.page) page; the report is dated 11/20/23.

## 2023 five-year accessibility plan

per [local law 12](https://nyc.legistar1.com/nyc/attachments/c8d9553e-2c9e-4a53-b247-686a70bc7377.pdf), every city agency was required to complete a five-year accessibility plan, in consultation with MOPD, by 12/31/23. as of 1/5/24, the list of **[proposed agency plans](https://accessibilityplans.cityofnewyork.us/agency-plans/)** finally includes the mayor's office.

[local law 12](https://nyc.legistar1.com/nyc/attachments/c8d9553e-2c9e-4a53-b247-686a70bc7377.pdf) seems more concerned about some agencies than others, & specifies next steps for "the office," here meaning the MOPD:

>"If any agency or entity, including, but not limited to the **metropolitan transportation authority** does not develop a five-year accessibility plan, the office shall conduct outreach with such agency or entity to share best practices and recommendations regarding accessibility with such agency or entity.

>"No later than 90 days after the outreach required by paragraph 1 of this subdivision, if an agency or entity does not develop a five-year accessibility plan, the office shall post on its website a statement that such agency or entity did not develop such plan and a summary of the best practices and recommendations that the office shared with such agency or entity pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision."
